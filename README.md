## Best Practices

### For Optimal Recognition
- Ensure good lighting
- Keep hands within marked area
- Hold gestures steady
- Maintain consistent distance
- Use plain background

### For Best Performance
- Regular camera checks
- Clear recognition area
- Update model as needed
- Monitor system resources

## Running the Application

Start the application:
```bash
python gui3.py
```

## System Requirements
- Working webcam
- Python 3.x environment
- Sufficient lighting
- Stable background
- Adequate processing power

## Notes
- Recognition accuracy depends on lighting conditions
- Model performs best with clear hand gestures
- Regular calibration may improve results
- Performance varies with system capabilities
